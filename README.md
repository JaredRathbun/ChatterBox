# ChatterBox
This repository holds the code for my team's final project in our Network Security class. 

ChatterBox is a group-chatting software, allowing multiple users to communicate simultaneously in a confidential and secure fashion.

Note: This repository holds two separate Netbeans projects; one for the Server and the other for the Client. There should only be one instance of the Server running and any number of Clients.
